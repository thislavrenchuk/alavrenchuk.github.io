# Introduction:

**Name**: The Oddity Office
[itch.io](https://anasaurus.itch.io/the-oddity-office)
**Project Goal**: learn about 2D game development, and create a basic quest system in C++.
**Project structure**: Developer in a 3 people team working to a 5-day deadline. 

The game was a result of a 5-day Game Jam challenge on the theme of "monster". The game also had to be a pixel game. I was keen to try my hand at 2D games, to experience the challenges of 2D game implementation, and the team came up with an office sim idea.
