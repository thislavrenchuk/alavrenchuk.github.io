**Name**: For Future
Itch.io: TBA
**Project Goal**: Develop a mechanic for using arrows for close melee combat as well as throwables. 
**Project structure**: Solo-project. Designed the system, combat mechanic, and art direction. 

> When your home is overrun with intruders that stand in the way of your child's only hope of survival, what will you do to protect her future?

# Story:

> The goal of the game is to secure the "Life's Elixir" that keeps the incubation system going and the child alive.

I left this simple, as to be able to focus on the combat mechanics and level design.

# Design:

The focus of the project was on a combat mechanic, inspired by The Last of Us melee weapon system. I wanted to expand on the usual bow-and-arrow mechanic, incorporating the weapon-expiry concept into the individual components that make up the weapon: the bow and the arrows. A survivor in a zombie apocalypse would you use either just as much as they would combine them for the standard weapon. If the player found arrows but no bow, or if the bow had "broken", the player should use the arrows as they would a shiv or dagger. The same idea for the bow - if the player has used up all their arrows (or hasn't found any in the first place), they would use the bow as a bat, whipping it at their enemy. 

## Art Direction

To give the game a darker mood, I took inspiration from the "comic noir", setting up a mood board.

## Level Design

With the above in mind, I envisioned a narrow-space setting in which the player would have opportunity for close-quarters mellee attacks. A house, through which they can discreetly make their way, getting rid of enemies, ultimately to reach the top floor where the goal of the game lies.
